# Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

### Game Features

This game allows two players to choose from the list of images available on the page.
The selected images are displayed against their **names** and **scores**.

Player 1 can take the first move followed by Player 2, who-ever marks the first horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the round and would score 10 points for each win.

You can play as many rounds as you want to.

If you want to start afresh, **Reset** button would start the game from first setting the scores back to 0.

The game allows you to choose from  available ***gifs*** to make it more ***animated*** and interesting.

The game is drawn when neither of the players marks a full row and the grid color changes to ***bisque*** color. A drawn game will not impact the scores.

## Technologies Used

The technologies used in developing the game are:
1. `HTML`
2. `CSS`
3. `Javascript`
4. `JQuery v3.0`

This game has two Javascript files: `tictactoe.js` and `tictactoe2.js`.
While the first one has the Javascript functions and logic of Tic Tac Toe game, second one is mostly written in JQuery to work on DOM elements and manipulate the DOM elements to give the presentation.

## Future Release:
The option of playing with computer and difficulty levels is in progress and will be included shortly.
